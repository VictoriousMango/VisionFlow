# VisionFlow
A computer vision-based tool that analyzes workflow diagrams from images and generates either SQL database schemas or executable code (e.g., Python). Built with OpenCV and Tesseract OCR, it detects shapes, extracts text, and interprets workflows intelligently. Ideal for automating diagram-to-code/schema conversion.
